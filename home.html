						<p> On 1 September, the Heikamp boarding school in Maasmechelen, Limburg, will launch a new programme to develop students’ entrepreneurial skills.</p>
						<p>“Today’s education system insufficiently prepares students for the business world in general, and for entrepreneurship in particular,” Denis Vonckers, general director of the community education network’s Maasland school group, told Het Nieuwsblad. “With our new approach, we target parents who don’t want their children to be the followers, but the leaders of the future.”
The boarding school will work with monthly themes, which will be introduced by an expert. “To make sure that our programme is balanced, we asked the professional associations of entrepreneurs for advice,” explained school principal Manette Bambust. The team of educators will adapt the course materials to the level of class groups, which span the ages of six to 18.
The themes addressed will include public relations and marketing, communication and presentation techniques, sales methods, financial management, leadership skills, teamwork and organisational abilities.
The project is being supported by Hasselt University’s faculty of economics and by the Erasmus University College Brussels.</p>
